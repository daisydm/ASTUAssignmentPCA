practice assignment on PCA(Principal Component Analysis)

1.The dataset given for this problem consists of data extracted from satellite images. The number of features is 36.

2.Reduce the dimensionality of the dataset using PCA. The threshold limits for the eigenvalues should be varied from 0.9 to 0.97 in steps of 0.01.

3.Obtain the Scree plot for each of these cases. Find the number of principal components retained due to the thresholding.
